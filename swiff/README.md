[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/swiff.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swiff)

Swiff saves you time with common SSH tasks during the development of websites/apps

ðŸš€ **Folder push and pull**<br>
Keep folders in sync between servers

ðŸ’« **Database push and pull**<br>
Manage the database between servers (auto backup)

ðŸŽ© **Composer file push and pull**<br>

ðŸ’» **Remote terminal connection**<br>
Launch a SSH session directly into the remote site/app folder

## Getting started

1. Install Swiff globally with npm:<br>
`npm install --global swiff`

2. Run `swiff` within a project folder to start the task interface

Run `swiff --help` for a list of flags to run a specific task

## Additional features

- Custom SSH identity: Swiff will attempt to use your identity located at: `/Users/[currentUser]/.ssh/id_rsa`<br>
You can specify a custom SSH key path in your .env file with:<br>
`SWIFF_CUSTOM_KEY="/Users/[your-user]/.ssh/[key-filename]"`
- Gzipped backups: Your files and database get backed up and gzipped whenever they change
- Disable specific tasks: Specify the tasks to disable with a config setting

## Requirements

Swiff requires MySQL to use the database features.
We recommend using MariaDB, an enhanced, drop-in replacement for MySQL.
`brew install mariadb@10.2` (latest as of April 2019)

For the Database & Composer tasks, a PEM format SSH key is required<br>
